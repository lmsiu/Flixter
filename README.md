### Notes

A challenge I had while building the app was the app kept crashing when I changed screens. I figured out that this was because the id I was using to refer to the overview textbox was not set to what I thought it was. This taught me that I have to pay attention to what I name things. I also had trouble with the YouTube player and found out that a 30 emulator was not comaptible with the YouTube player and had to switch to a 29 one. 
Total time spent on part 2: 3 hours

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x ] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [ ] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Some challenges I had while developing the app were getting used to using the RecyclerView. I'm still getting used to making adapters too. 
I also had some challenges with the design. The movie overview would get cut off if it was to long so I fixed this by making the height of the TextView wrap content.
I spent 4 hours on part 1.
Overall pretty fun though XD
